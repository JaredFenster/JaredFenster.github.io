      <ul>
        <li>The base of the robot is constructed with 2040 Aluminum Extrusion with Linear Rails to allow the wheels to seperate</li>
        <li>The rest of the robot apart from the bearings and Steel Rods is completely 3D printed with PLA</li>
        <li>Each Mecanum Wheel's height is manipulated using 150kg servos driving a herringbone rack and pinion</li>
        <li>The main 2 stage lifting mechanism to reveal the rings is controlled by an internal mechanism consisting of linear bearings a 150kg servo for each stage</li>
        <li>The rings each have an internal ring gear driven by seperate motors</li>
        <li>The head is manimulated by a Stewart Platform with an additional motor for the spinning motion</li>

      <h2>Final Result & Takeaways</h2>
      <p>
        This was my first major project! It took about a year to complete, with many major redesigns. It was completely designed in Fusion 360 and 3D printed on my BambuLab X1C. In the end I was fairly satisfied with how it turned out. If I were to come back to this project, I would do things very different, especially ditching the Arduino.
